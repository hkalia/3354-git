(c) What is the difference between git log and git status?
git log allows you to view the commit history. It has many different options to format and browse
the commit history.

git status shows you the current status of the working directory, such as the current changes to tracked files.
How many commits you are ahead of master and other pertinent information. It is not meant to be used to browse
the commit history.

(d) What is the difference between unstaged and untracked files?
Unstaged files are tracked by git. This means that git will track whether they have been modified or deleted.
Since it is unstaged it will not be included in a commit.

Untracked files are not tracked by git. That means that if they are modified or deleted, git will not care.

(e) What is the difference between git checkout and git reset?
git checkout is used to move between branches. It can also be used to create new branches with the -b option.

git reset is used to undo a commit by deleting a it. It should not be used since it is better to use git revert.

(f) What happens if you try to pull remote changes when there are uncommitted
changes in your working directory?
Git will prevent you from pulling. It will ask you to either commit or stash your changes before you can pull.
